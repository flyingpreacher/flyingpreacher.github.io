I have been wanting to build this site for so long, and now I finally have the chance.

This site is built with Jekyll and as you can see, it is hosted on Github pages. The site always worked locally, but I could never get it to work on Github Pages. Here is what I did from my Github repository:
Go to Settings -- > Pages --> Select gh-pages as a branch and /root as a directory.

I think it took about 5-10 mins to kick in, but once it did, I was golden! 

The following bash commands are what is used to prepare to install Jekyll:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git
```

I will be testing more stuff as I go on this journey with you so stay tuned!
